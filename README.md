# react-scad minimal example

A minimal [react-scad](https://github.com/react-scad/react-scad) project: one cube, one sphere, unioned and written to `model.scad`.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+
- **npm** (or pnpm / yarn)

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Run

**`npm run dev`** — Use when developing: watches your files and re-runs on changes so the `.scad` output updates as you edit.

```bash
npm run dev
```

**`npm start`** — Use for a single run: generates the output once and exits (e.g. one-off build, CI, or when you don’t need watch).

```bash
npm start
```
